/// `trackRevision` is a cross-platform contract (`lib/src/vlc_player_value.dart`)
/// that only the five native backends can honour, and none of them is
/// reachable from a Dart test: macOS/iOS are Swift over VLCKit, Android is
/// Kotlin over libvlc-android, Windows/Linux share the C++ core. What can be
/// pinned here is the shape of the derivation, which is exactly where the two
/// defects lived:
///
///  * the polling backends (macOS, iOS, Windows, Linux) derived the revision
///    from the track COUNT, so a same-size swap - an adaptive rendition change
///    or an MPEG-TS PMT update replacing the audio/spu ES - never moved it and
///    left the panel drawing the old names with nothing ticked;
///  * Android bumped on every ESAdded/ESDeleted including the video stream, so
///    a video-only ES change reloaded a track list that had not changed and
///    yanked the D-pad cursor back to the active row.
///
/// The C++ half of the first defect additionally has a behavioural test in
/// `test/native/vlc_player_core_test_suite.h`
/// (`VlcPlayerCore.TrackSetFingerprintMovesOnASameSizeSwap`).
