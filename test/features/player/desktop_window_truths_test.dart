/// Two desktop lies the player used to tell.

/// The first is full screen. `_isFullscreen` was only ever written by the
/// player's own toggle, so anything else that moved the window - the app-wide
/// F11 handler in main.dart, the macOS green button, the window menu - left the
/// flag stale: the button showed the wrong icon and Escape, which the controls
/// gate on that flag, did nothing. The window is the only thing that knows, so
/// the proof here is that the *window's* events move the flag, with no toggle
/// call anywhere in the test.
///
/// The second is video fit. `VlcPlayer` builds its own FittedBox from `fit`,
/// but the screen constructed it with no `fit:` at all, so the texture path was
/// pinned to contain no matter what the viewer's default resize mode said -
/// and on Windows and Linux the native `setFit` the controls call is a no-op,
/// so nothing else was going to honour it either.
///
/// The texture platform is the subject for the same reason the PiP test uses
/// it: `create` answers with its own view id, so the test knows which event
/// channel to speak on to get a first frame and reach the playing stage.
