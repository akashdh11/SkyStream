/// One stateful engine fake for every app-side player test.
///
/// `VlcPlayerController` has a private constructor, so a test cannot hand the
/// widgets a stub controller; the real one is attached to a fake *engine*
/// instead - a mock 'vlc_player' method channel plus a mock event stream - and
/// the argument shapes stay honest as a side effect.
///
/// Unlike a handler that answers null to everything, this fake keeps the
/// engine's state: the track lists, which audio and subtitle track is on, and
/// a revision that ticks whenever the list changes. That is what makes the
/// assertions about the *active* track - "the panel opens focused on the row
/// that is playing" - writable at all: `emit` stamps the state into every
/// snapshot the way the natives do, so the controller's value follows it.
///
/// Hygiene, learned the hard way:
///  * A playing controller keeps a 1 s stall watchdog armed and flutter_test
///    checks for pending timers *before* `addTearDown` runs. A test that ends
///    in healthy playback must `dispose()` its controller in the body or emit a
///    `{'state': 'paused'}` snapshot first.
///  * Dispose the controller before the fake: `controller.dispose()` still
///    sends `dispose` to the engine, and a channel with no handler throws.
///  * Call [attach] *inside* the `testWidgets` body, never in `setUp`, when
///    an `eventThrottleInterval` is given: the controller's throttle timer is
///    created in whatever zone the first throttled snapshot arrives in, and
///    a controller built outside the test body owns a timer flutter_test's
///    fake async cannot see or drive.
///  * `onListen`/`onCancel` on the event stream are block-bodied on purpose.
///    flutter_test hands `onListen`'s return value back as the `listen` reply
///    (test_default_binary_messenger.dart), and an arrow that returns the
///    assigned sink is a reply the codec cannot encode - a failure only a
///    widget test reports, which is how it went unnoticed under `test()`.
