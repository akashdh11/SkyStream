/// Skip Outro, from the screen down: what the press actually does to the
/// session, and who owns the bottom-right corner while it is happening.
///
/// The press means "I am done with this episode". Before this it was answered
/// by seeking *further into* the episode — to the end of the credits band and
/// no further — which on any encode whose credits end before the file does
/// leaves the viewer watching a next-episode preview or a logo tail until the
/// up-next card's own fifteen-second window opens on its own. It now raises
/// that card at once, through the card the player already has: one countdown,
/// one advance path, nothing to keep in step.
///
/// Two rules hold the rest of it together and both are load-bearing:
///
///  * OWNER DECISION 7. The seek happens BEFORE anything advances, and it
///    lands past the completion line rather than on the band's end.
///    `PlaybackTracker.finish()` judges the session from the last sample taken
///    while playing, and `_markedWatched` needs `sample.isComplete` — so an
///    advance issued from inside an outro that started at 83 % reports a
///    `scrobbleStop` to Trakt and Simkl where the viewer earned a play, on
///    accounts this app has no way to correct.
///  * ONE PROMPT PER CORNER. The chip and the up-next card are both
///    bottom-right, and the card is a later child of the screen's Stack, so
///    the chip used to survive underneath it: a tap that lands on the card on
///    touch, and an invisible D-pad stop inside the card's rectangle on a
///    remote, for the whole overlap window — which for a typical outro is
///    every second the card is up.
