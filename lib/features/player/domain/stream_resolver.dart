/// opaque token handed to the active plugin's `loadStreams()`, and plugins are
/// free to put anything in it — an episode page, a `tmdb:` id, or a JSON array
/// of candidate sources. Phase 5's VlcPlayerScreen assumed it was a URI and
/// called `Uri.parse` on it, which threw a FormatException the first time a

///
/// Resolution is entirely engine-agnostic — it ends at a [StreamResult], and
/// nothing here knows or cares which engine opens it.
/// So it lives here rather than in either player, and both can share it.
///
/// The old PlayerController still has its own private copies of these steps
/// (`_handleSpecialProviders`, `_resolveProvider`, `_processStreams`,
/// `_findSavedStreamIndex`, `_findFirstWorkingStream`,
/// `_isStreamCandidateHealthy`). They are deliberately left alone: that
/// controller is deleted in Phase 8, and refactoring 5,000 lines of shipping
/// playback mid-migration buys nothing that deleting it will not.
