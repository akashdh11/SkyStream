/// The seek bar for the VLC engine.
///
/// Deliberately thin: it holds only the drag position and the seek latch, and
/// renders through the shared [PlayerScrubber]. Nothing here decides what the
/// chrome looks like, so the overlay cannot drift from the shared design —
/// there is one scrubber implementation and both engines feed it.
///
/// It listens to the controller directly rather than through Riverpod, so a
/// position tick rebuilds this widget and nothing above it.
///
/// The latch: when a seek is handed to the engine the controller keeps
/// publishing the engine's own position (a faked one would poison the resume
/// point writer), so for up to a snapshot round-trip the thumb would jump back
/// to where playback *was* and the clock with it. This widget holds the seek
/// target in its place until the engine has evidently honoured the seek, or
/// the media stops, or a timeout longer than the controller's stall delay has
/// passed - so a genuine post-seek stall shows the spinner with the thumb still
/// on the target, and only then falls back to the truth. Relative D-pad steps
/// chain from the latched target as a side effect, because the seek bar reads
/// its start value from what is displayed.
