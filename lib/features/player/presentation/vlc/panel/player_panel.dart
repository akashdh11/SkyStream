/// The player's side panel: Sources, Audio, Subtitles, Episodes and Files in
/// one right-anchored drawer instead of four bottom sheets.
///
/// A sheet is the wrong container for any of this away from a phone held
/// upright — see player_panel_shell.dart, which owns the shape — but the reason
/// they are one panel rather than four is the remote. Four sheets are four
/// journeys out to a button row and back; a panel with a tab strip is one, and
/// a viewer comparing a source against its audio tracks never leaves it.
///
/// FOCUS, which is where the sheets it replaces fell down:
///
///   * Opening moves focus onto the row that is selected now, not row one, so
///     the first press changes something the viewer chose rather than finding
///     the list.
///   * Closing returns focus to the control that opened the panel. That falls
///     out of the panel being a route: the scope below keeps its focused child
///     and gets it back when this one is popped, which is also why the chrome
///     must be *held* open while the panel is up — the button focus returns to
///     has to still be there.
///   * Every row is one focus stop ([PanelRow]), tab switching is a row of
///     ordinary focusable buttons rather than a scrollable [TabBar], and
///     nothing here hand-routes an arrow key.
///
/// DATA is live and arrives as one value: the screen publishes a [PanelData]
/// through a `ValueListenable` and the panel rebuilds from it, so a failover,
/// a late probe or a torrent poll moves the tick, the chips and the badges in
/// place. The row a list opens on and focuses is decided once, from the value
/// at open, and a later value never scrolls or refocuses - see
/// player_panel_data.dart and player_anchored_list.dart.
///
/// TEN-FOOT: every size, inset and text alpha in the panel comes from
/// [PlayerPanelMetrics], installed once here and read off the context by the
/// rows, badges, subheaders and tabs below. The touch ramp is the literal set
/// these widgets were written with, so a phone, a tablet and a desktop window
/// are unchanged; the television ramp is about 1.2x the type, a 48 dp overscan
/// inset and paddings that make a row and a tab one whole focus target.
///
/// COMPOSITING: the panel is drawn over a platform view. It animates in with a
/// [SlideTransition] — a transform, not a window-sized opacity layer — and its
/// surface is opaque, with no blur anywhere. The five rules in
/// vlc_player_controls.dart apply here in full.
