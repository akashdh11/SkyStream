/// Chrome for the VLC engine — Phase 5b of the migration notes.
///
/// The design is not reimplemented here. [PlayerTopBar], [PlayerBottomBar],
/// [PlayerIconButton] and the shared scrubber are the same widgets the
/// media_kit overlay uses, so "no visual diff" holds by construction rather
/// than by inspection, and any future change to the design lands on both paths
/// at once.
///
/// What *is* rebuilt is the machinery, which is where the old overlay
/// (skystream_player_controls.dart, 1684 lines) went wrong:
///
///   * Its auto-hide timer is restarted from **16** separate call sites, so
///     chrome vanishes mid-interaction whenever a path forgets - or, when a
///     path cancels it and nothing re-arms, never goes at all. Here the timer
///     has no surface: [ChromeVisibilityController] owns it, callers report
///     what happened (a poke, a toggle, a hold for the life of a sheet, a drag
///     or a resting mouse) and the clock is a consequence.
///   * It hand-manages **6** FocusNodes and hand-routes D-pad Up out of the
///     scrubber. Here the controls are ordinary focusable widgets in reading
///     order inside the same FocusTraversalGroup, and native traversal moves
///     between them. The three nodes this State owns route nothing: a key
///     sink that holds focus whenever no control does, the chrome root so "is
///     a control focused" is one question, and play/pause, where the D-pad
///     starts. The sink exists because on a remote focus *is* the pointer:
///     the route scope holding it would spend every arrow re-focusing the
///     scope, and there is no tap to recover with. controls_focus_test.dart
///     holds that focus is always a control or the sink, never the scope.
///   * It reads playerControllerProvider **72** times, only 30 of them
///     filtered, so an unrelated state change rebuilds the whole overlay. Here
///     the only high-frequency value — position — is consumed by a
///     ValueListenableBuilder inside [VlcProgressBar], so a tick rebuilds the
///     scrubber and nothing else.
///
/// And the compositing rules, which exist because on macOS and iOS this chrome
/// sits over a platform view, not a texture. Flutter backs every layer over a
/// platform view with its own IOSurface, sized to the layer and rebuilt when
/// the layer comes or goes; a window-sized opacity layer torn down on each hide
/// is what produced black frames, and Android never showed it because its
/// video is a texture. controls_layer_shape_test.dart holds these:
///
///   * Nothing that changes at pointer or tick rate lives on this State. The
///     toast and the rail are [TransientValue]s rendered by one
///     [TransientOverlay] each; position is the scrubber's alone.
///   * The spinner keys on `isStalled || isBuffering`, never on the libVLC
///     state alone. Only Android reports `buffering` mid-play; VLCKit and the
///     desktop backends stay `playing` through a rebuffer, so a state-only
///     spinner left a frozen frame under a pause glyph for as long as the
///     stall watchdog took to act. The controller raises `isStalled` from its
///     position clock, and the play/pause glyph reads buffering as playing,
///     since the film will resume without a press.
///   * Exactly one setState per user-visible mode change - show, hide, toggle
///     the torrent panel, cycle the fit. Not per pointer move, not per frame.
///   * Anything drawn over the video gets its own [RepaintBoundary], so a
///     scrubber tick, a toast or a rail repaints itself and nothing beside it.
///   * No BackdropFilter or ImageFiltered over the video, ever. Either one
///     reads the surface back on every repaint.
///   * No single opacity or filter layer may span both bars. Each bar fades
///     on its own, so each layer is bar-sized and the spacer between them is
///     in neither.
///
/// Buttons whose backend does not exist on this path are **absent, not
/// disabled**, and so are buttons the current device cannot honour: the screen
/// passes null for anything unavailable rather than this file guessing. A
/// missing feature should be obviously missing. The five list buttons -
/// Sources, Audio, Subtitles, Episodes, Files - follow the same rule through
/// [panelTabs]: each is rendered only when the panel would show that tab, so
/// button presence and tab presence are one decision (`availablePanelTabs`)
/// and focus can never land on a control whose list does not exist. Cast,
/// download and lock are still the ones with no backend at all.
